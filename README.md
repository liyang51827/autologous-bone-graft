# autologous-bone-graft

> Autologous bone graft is a surgical procedure where a piece of bone is removed from one part of the patient's body, typically from the hip or pelvis, and transplanted to another area that requires bone tissue. This type of graft is considered "autologous" because the bone comes from the patient's own body, reducing the risk of rejection or infection. Autologous bone grafts are commonly used in orthopedic surgeries to promote bone healing and fusion, such as in cases of spinal fusion, joint replacement, and certain types of fractures.
